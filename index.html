      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My husband and I recently moved to the Seattle area from Portland. I work in Human Resources and, as exciting as that is *wink wink*, I am thrilled to be learning something to set me on a new path.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I grew up in Southern California, but claim the PNW as home.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love anything outside, but my favorite outdoor activity is backpacking.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Though I'm still learning about myself and exactly where I would excel in this field, I know I'm on the right track.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Auburn, WA</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After spending 6-9 months on a software implementation with my current job, I realized just how much I enjoy working with tech. I was intrigued by all the functionality of our new system and ways it could be better. Then I would find myself asking questions and learning about softwares my family and friends were using at their jobs. In short, I want to do this job because I want the products I create improve the lives and experiences of those that use it.</p>
